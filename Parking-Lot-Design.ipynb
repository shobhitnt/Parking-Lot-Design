    "## Features\r\n",
    "- Designed a Parking Lot Management System from scratch applying OOPs concepts in Python.\r\n",
    "- Simulated a real-life scenario of the randomized system to test the functionality of the system.\r\n",
    "- Comprehensive Log Generation for monitoring the scenario.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Languages Used\r\n",
    "- Python\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Assumptions and Constraints\r\n",
    "- The parking layout envisioned was a multilevel Parking Area. A parking Area having multiple floors (levels) and each floor having slots like grid divided into rows and columns.\r\n",
    "- We assumed that different vehicles would take different area to park depending on their dimensions. \r\n",
    "  - Motorcycle would take 1 Grid Cell.\r\n",
    "  - Car would take 2 Grid Cells.\r\n",
    "  - Bus would take 3 Grid Cells.\r\n",
    "- Vehicles can **only** be parked in one single row of parking space. As in horizontally only. Since between different rows would be a space, so that vehicles could move in and out of parking area.\r\n"
