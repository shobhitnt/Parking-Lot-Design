# Parking-Lot-Design
## Features
- Designed a Parking Lot Management System from scratch applying OOPs concepts in Python.
- Simulated a real-life scenario of the randomized system to test the functionality of the system.
- Comprehensive Log Generation for monitoring the scenario.

## Languages Used
- Python

## Assumptions and Constraints
- The parking layout envisioned was a multilevel Parking Area. A parking Area having multiple floors (levels) and each floor having slots like grid divided into rows and columns.
- We assumed that different vehicles would take different area to park depending on their dimensions. 
  - Motorcycle would take 1 Grid Cell
  - Car would take 2 Grid Cells
  - Bus would take 3 Grid Cells
- Vehicles can **only** be parked in one single row of parking space. As in horizontally only. Since between different rows would be a space, so that vehicles could move in and out of parking area.

## Output
Output is generated in a file name "dump.txt" in the same directory as the code.
